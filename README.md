# I_O_Shape_Experiement_RNNs
In this project, we make an attempt to investigate shapes of inputs and outputs, in various situations when feeding to RNNs, LSTMs, GRU. While creating RNN based models are important,  understanding the shape transformations happening to the input and output gives us a better picture.
